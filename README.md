# Python
Python Learning and Practice

### hello
We start with hello world

### variables
Python variables Types. Practice varibale types with examples.

### data types
Python data types. Python data types with examples. integer, float, strings...

### dynamically type
Python is a dynamically type language. we can change a defined variable value in runtime.

### conditional statement
Usage of if else elif condition

### nested if else
Handle conditions with nested if else statements.

### formatted Print. Print output in formatted manner
We can use all 4 methods I define here and last one is the latest method. 

### getting User Inputs
We can get user inputs using input() function. 

### 9. in and not in operators
To check any strings, characters in a varible.

### 10. indexing
Access the string value in a variable. Access the charactes in variable.

### 11. methods
We use methods and fuctions to get done some specific works.
upper, lower, title, capitalize, find, rfind, index, center, ljust, rjust, strip, lstrip, rstrip

### 12. string methods further
use methodds - startswith, endswith, replace, join, split, splitlines

### 13. list data types
uses of list data type and return values in a list using index. uses of methods to add and remove values to list. append(), extend(), insert(), pop(), remove(), clear()

### 14. tuple data type
uses of tuple data type and change list in to tuple. only different in tuple from list is tuple is a immutable data type. we cannot change tuple in runtime.

### 15. set data type
uses of set data type. used of methods and mathematical operations. add(), update(), remove(), discard(), union(), intersection() and difference()

### 16. dictionary data type
uses of dictionary data type. access values using key value, add single values and multiple values, remove values, clear dictionary.

### 17. while loop
uses of while loop. excercise : get 5 input values from user and then return the sum of the input values.
we should have define a condition and while loop runs only the condition is True and until the condition is True.

### 18. for loop
uses of for loop. return values in a list and a dictionary.

### 18. continue and break statements
In continue when the condition is true in if statement or what ever state skip once that moment
In break, when the condition is true the it stops the program

### 19. break and continue statements
uses of break and continue statements in loop

### 20. functions and create function
Create function and pass paramenters to it to get an output

### 20.1 default arguments and pass dictionary as a parameter
uses of default arguments and pass dictionary as parameter and display it.

### 21. create class and access the method in the class using objects
To access a method inside a class we should create a object. We can create objects as many as we want.
We can call a variable created in the method inside a class using a object as well.

### 22. __init__ method
uses of __init__ method. speciality of the ini method is everytime we create an object this method runs automatically.

### 23. encapsulation
private variables and methods. access thoese private methods and variables through public methods.

### 24. inheritance
There are three types of inheritance
 Single level inheritance - Access a parent/super class by a child/sub class
 Multiple inheritance - Access multiple parent classes by a child class
 Multi level inheritance - Access a parent class via another parent class by a child class

 ### 25. exercise in inheritance
 Buy fruits from a shop and calculate total cost for the fruits we bought.

 ### 26. create module and do exercise to create a cal

 ### 27. datetime module
 uses of datetime module. various methods of printing date and time.

 ### 28. factorial
calculate a factorial value of a given number exercise.

### 29. recursion
calculate factorial value using recursion method.

### 30. lambda function
lambda function and use lambda function inside a function

### 31. filter, map and reduce functions
uses of filter, map and reduce functions and uses of these functions with lambda function

### 32. decorator function
use of decorator function and provide a function as a parametor inside a function.

### 33. name variable
Create 2 Modules and call function in Module1 from Module2

### 34. pholymorphism
Method Overriding
Method Overloading
Operator Overloading

### 35. exception handling
use of try: except: finally: blocks

### 36. arrays
uses of arrays and types of arrays, join array

### 37. iterators
uses of iterators

### 38. create own iterator
create own iterator to print even values
